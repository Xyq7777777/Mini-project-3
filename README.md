## React Native App
React Native is an open source cross-platform frameworks which are used to develop applications for both Android and iOS platforms. One application can run across both platforms.
That means developers save almost half of their time and development cost. It was made open source in 2015 and since it has grown to become the most favored technology for most of the top industries including Facebook (itself), UberEats and many others.

### Pros React Native
- Saves Development Time  
Almost 40% of development time can be saved when you use React Native framework. When you use React Native to develop an application from the start till deployment take comparatively less time than Native app development.

- Easy for Web Developers  
Turning to mobile app developer is a complex task for a web developer has to do while React Native provides solutions for it. Being a JavaScript framework, transitions become absolutely easy for Web developers.

- Open Source Framework  
React Native is an open source mobile app development technology. That means you can freely download it and develop applications. Besides, it comes with the opportunity for developers to understand the framework by inspecting the codes and even improve the framework if they come across any bugs in it.

### Cons of React Native
- Immaturity  
According to Airbnb report, immaturity was one of the main reasons it dropped the technology. The report said that React Native is moving quickly which good in some cases but creates plenty of other issues as well.

- Cannot Support All Native APIs  
React Native supports some APIs, but most important Native APIs, but at the time, it does not have the freedom to use all Native APIs. That means developers working with React Native needs access to other APIs and functionality through native modules.

- Design Creates Ruckus  
iOS and Android follow different design guidelines. In the case of React Native, the graphical elements are transformed automatically, but placement stay differs from each other. In such a case, developers need to develop separate code to follow the design guidelines.

### Pros of Native Development(IOS & Android)
- API Access  
Native frameworks come up with built in API and libraries that enable developers to access them directly. All the features and functionalities offered by APIs can be obtained instantly. These APIs are dedicated and have no extra layer mapping. Hence they do not require updates and have no restrictions at all.

- Performance  
Apps developed with Native are unbeatable in performance. For example, it involves dedicated technology such as Swift & Java for iOS & Android respectively. These technologies provide everything that they require to give a complete finish to the application. Hence, choose the framework wisely.

- Third Party Libraries  
Abundance in third-party libraries gives freedom to developers to make robust, effective and customized applications. The benefits you get with a Native development environment due to its large community. You have plenty of resources to help you improve your development experience and applications.

### Cons of Native Development(IOS & Android)
- Consumes Lots of Time & Efforts   
Developing an application using Native frameworks requires lots of time and efforts. It uses native programming languages which slows down the development process. If you are looking for apps on both platform, then you need to develop two applications for iOS and Android separately.

- Develop Two Application  
You should create a separate application for each platform. For example, you cannot use Java for both Android & iOS app development. Similarly, Swift also cannot be used for iOS and Android app development together.

## Conclusion
React Native and Native development both are integral to application development. However, the use of a certain development depends on the platforms you choose. Besides, you have various other factors which play the role. However, if high performance, scalable and high-traffic oriented applications are in demand, Native development will be the right decision.
